# **PhoboSphere**  
*Gamified Exposure Therapy for Apple Vision Pro*  

PhoboSphere is a **gamified exposure therapy** application built for **Apple Vision Pro** to help individuals gradually overcome phobias.  
Leveraging **spatial computing** and **mixed reality**, it blends immersive 3D environments with progressive fear levels, guided by **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** principles.  

Unlike traditional therapy, which can feel repetitive and disconnected, **PhoboSphere** offers a *personalized, interactive journey* where users face fears at their own pace.  
The system measures **physiological** and **behavioral** responses using Vision Pro’s **eye tracking**, **hand tracking**, and **spatial awareness**.
